Soln:

 H0= 100
 H1 = H0>100

assumption= 0.05 (5% as significance level)

z score in z-table:

(z score)z=(x-mean)/SD

z= (108-100)/(15/squareroot(36) = 3.20

p-value associated with 3.20 = 0.993(probality of having value less than 108 is 0.9993)


probability of null hypotheis is less than 0.05 (5%). hence it is rejected
