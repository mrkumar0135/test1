Solution:

X-value:

Z = (1100-mean)/sigma

Mean in z-score equation:

Z = (1100 - 1026)/sigma


standard deviation, sigma in z-score equation:

Z = (1100-1026)/209 = 0.354066

this score 0.354066 SD is above mean


z-value in z-table to find % of test-takers scored below 0.354066

z-score of 0.354066 = 0.6368 = 63.68%
